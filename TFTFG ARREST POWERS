THEYFEARTRUTH FEDERAL ARREST POWERS ACT

OFFICIAL DECLARATION OF SOVEREIGNTY
THEYFEARTRUTH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF AMERICA
Filed from the Office of the United States Congress Chambers: The Senate and House of Representatives

Date: May 29,2025
Filed by: Rico Cortez Dukes, Chief Officer
Address: 1818 Corsicana Street, Dallas, Texas 75201

PREAMBLE

We, the undersigned and lawfully appointed representatives of Theyfeartruth Federal Government of America, do hereby solemnly and officially declare our standing as an independent sovereign Federal Government, operating within our own authority, laws, and jurisdiction—separate and distinct from the incorporated federal structure of the United States Government.

This declaration is made in alignment with the foundational right of self-determination as recognized in:

The United Nations Charter (Articles 1 and 55),

The U.S. Constitution (particularly the Ninth and Tenth Amendments),

The Law of Nations, and

The precedents established by Indigenous Sovereign Nations and Ecclesiastical Governments, including the Moorish Science Temple of America.

HISTORICAL PARALLELS

As has been done by Native American Tribes, Moorish Americans, and other ecclesiastical and autonomous governments that have filed formal recognition notices and charter-based declarations of sovereignty, Theyfeartruth Federal Government of America now issues this declaration to the United States Congress, placing the federal legislative body on full constructive and lawful notice.

Our model of sovereignty aligns with those entities who, through lawful declaration and administrative registration, have reclaimed authority over their people, land, and destiny without foreign interference.

DECLARATION

Now comes Theyfeartruth Federal Government of America, constituted as a natural, non-corporate government of indigenous and national citizens, and hereby proclaims:

1. Sovereign Status: We are not subject to the authority of the United States Incorporated or any foreign body politic. We operate by natural law, common law, and divine law.

2. Independent Jurisdiction: Our governance structure holds independent legislative, executive, and judicial branches governed by the people and for the people.

3. Government Recognition Filing: This declaration, like those filed by other sovereign entities under the Lobbying Disclosure Act and religious corporation codes, shall be part of the public Congressional record.

4. Non-Adversarial Status: We assert our sovereignty peacefully and lawfully. We are not at war with the United States but stand as a separate nation existing in parallel with mutual respect.

5. Public Record: This declaration shall be published in public repositories, official Congressional registries, and preserved through lawful publication for recognition and perpetuity.

CLOSING STATEMENT

Let it be known to all agencies, departments, courts, and corporations—foreign and domestic—that Theyfeartruth Federal Government of America stands now and forevermore as an independent, self-governing sovereign federal government.

Filed and declared under full authority granted by the divine laws of creation, common law jurisdiction, and the will of a free people.

Signed:

Rico Cortez Dukes
